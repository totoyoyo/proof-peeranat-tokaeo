% You can make any edits you like to this file. It is designed as a place
% for you to define your own macros that you want to use across many
% LaTeX documents. You can also define macros in a single document,
% but if you find yourself reusing the same macro in several documents,
% then it probably belongs in here. Look in the "%% Mathmode shortcuts"
% section of texHead-Proof-Standard.tex for some examples of how to define
% your own macros.
