\section{Mean-spirited} \label{sec:mean-spirited}

\begin{thm} \label{thm:mean-spirited}
	For all $a,b,c>0$,
	$$
		\frac{a^2}{bc} + \frac{b^2}{ca} + \frac{c^2}{ab} \geq 3.
	$$
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Invalid proof of theorem~\ref{thm:mean-spirited}]
	Suppose (for a contradiction) that
	$$
		\frac{a^2}{bc} + \frac{b^2}{ca} + \frac{c^2}{ab} < 3.
	$$
	Then this inequality must be true for the particular choice of $a=b=c=1>0$.
	But
	$$
		\frac{1^2}{1\times1} + \frac{1^2}{1\times1} + \frac{1^2}{1\times1} = 1+1+1 = 3 \not< 3.
	$$
	This contradicts our assumption, so the theorem is true. 
\end{proof}

\noindent\emph{Discussion}:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% THE ABOVE CLAIMED PROOF IS INCORRECT.
% WRITE A FEW SENTENCES TO EXPLAIN THE ERROR.
%
% 1. Is the theorem true or false. If the theorem is false, can you disprove it?
% 2. Whether or not the theorem is true, is the proof correct or incorrect? If there are any errors in the proof, point them out and, if possible, correct.
% 3. Are there any parts of the proof that could be made more efficient?
%
The negation on the Theorem's statement is done incorrectly. 
The statement is, $\forall a,b,c >0$, 
$$
	\frac{a^2}{bc} + \frac{b^2}{ca} + \frac{c^2}{ab} \geq 3.
$$ 
The correct negation would then be: there $\exists a,b,c >0$ such that 
$$
	\frac{a^2}{bc} + \frac{b^2}{ca} + \frac{c^2}{ab} < 3.
$$
The proof by contradiction above is done by giving one counterexample against the negation.
However, this is not sufficient because you have to show that there are no possible $a,b,$ or $c >0$ that satisfies the property. 
Therefore, the proof is incorrect.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{proof}[Correct proof of theorem~\ref{thm:mean-spirited}]
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	%
	% HINTS
	%
	% Use the AM-GM inequality.
	%
	From the AM-GM inequality, we know
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{a+b+c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc}. 
	\end{align*}
	Because we know $abc$ is a positive number, $\sqrt[3]{abc}$ is also positive. So, we can perform the following,
	\begin{align*}
	\frac{(a+b+c)(\sqrt[3]{abc})^2}{3} &\geq abc \\
	\frac{(a+b+c)}{(abc)^{\frac{1}{3}}} &\geq 3 \\
	\frac{(a)^{\frac{2}{3}}}{(bc)^{\frac{1}{3}}} + \frac{(b)^{\frac{2}{3}}}{(ac)^{\frac{1}{3}}} + \frac{(c)^{\frac{2}{3}}}{(ab)^{\frac{1}{3}}}&\geq 3 \\
	\sqrt[3]{\frac{a^2}{bc}}+\sqrt[3]{\frac{b^2}{ac}}+\sqrt[3]{\frac{c^2}{ab}}&\geq 3
	\end{align*}
	We know that all terms are positive in the above inequality, so,
	$$ \frac{a^2}{bc} + \frac{b^2}{ac} + \frac{c^2}{ac} \geq \sqrt[3]{\frac{a^2}{bc}}+\sqrt[3]{\frac{b^2}{ac}}+\sqrt[3]{\frac{c^2}{ab}}\geq3.$$
	This implies that 
	$$ \frac{a^2}{bc} + \frac{b^2}{ac} + \frac{c^2}{ac} \geq 3 .$$

\section{Rationals can always be expressed as ratios as arbitrary powers{\dots}or can they?}

\noindent\emph{The below claimed theorem and proof may or may not be correct.}

\begin{thm} \label{thm:power-rational}
	For each $m,n\in\NN$, and for every positive $x\in\QQ$, there exist $a,b\in\NN$ such that $x = a^m / b^n$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
	By definition, each positive rational can be expressed as $a^1/b^1$ for some choice of naturals $a,b$.
	Suppose that $x\in\QQ$ is such that $x=a^m/b$ for some $m\in\NN$.
	Then
	$$
		x = \frac{a^{m+1}}{ab} = \frac{(a)^{m+1}}{(ab)^1} = \frac{\alpha^{m+1}}{\beta},
	$$
	using $\alpha=a\in\NN$ and $\beta=ab\in\NN$.
	Hence, by induction on $m$, for every $m\in\NN$, and for every positive $x\in\QQ$, there exist $a,b\in\NN$ such that $x = a^m / b$.
	
	Now suppose that $x\in\QQ$ is such that $x=a/b^n$ for some $n\in\NN$.
	Then
	$$
		x = \frac{ab}{b^{n+1}} = \frac{(ab)^1}{(b)^{n+1}} = \frac{\alpha}{\beta^{n+1}},
	$$
	using $\alpha=ab\in\NN$ and $\beta=b\in\NN$.
	Hence, by induction on $n$, for every $n\in\NN$, and for every positive $x\in\QQ$, there exist $a,b\in\NN$ such that $x = a / b^n$.
	
	It follows that for every $m,n\in\NN$, and for every positive $x\in\QQ$, there exist $a,b\in\NN$ such that $x = a^m / b^n$.
\end{proof}

\section{An irrootional number}

\begin{defn} \label{defn:rootional}
	The \emph{rootionals} (or \emph{rootional numbers}) are the natural roots of rational numbers.
	They are the answers to the question ``Of what should I multiply $n$ copies to get $x$?'', when $0<x\in\QQ$, and $n\in\NN$.
	The \emph{set of rootionals} is denoted $\mathbb{P}$.
	A real number which is not rootional is called \emph{irrootional}.
\end{defn}

\begin{lem} \label{lem:powers-of-1+sqrt2}
	% THE SYMBOLS $\phi$ AND $\psi$ SHOULD NOT APPEAR ANYWHERE IN THE STATEMENT OF THE THEOREM OR THE PROOF WHEN YOU SUBMIT.
	% REPLACE $\phi$ and $\psi$ WITH EXPLICIT FORMULAE.
	The sequences $(a_n)_{n\in\NN}$, $(b_n)_{n\in\NN}$ given by
	\begin{align*}
		a_1 &= 1 & a_{n+1} &= a_n+2b_n, & n &\in\NN, \\
		b_1 &= 1 & b_{n+1} &= a_n+b_n, & n &\in\NN,
	\end{align*}
	satisfy both
	$$
		\left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)^n = a_n + b_n \sqrt{2} \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad a_n^2-2b_n^2 = (-1)^n,
	$$
	for all $n\in\NN$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	%
	% HINTS
	%
	% First you have to complete the statement of the lemma.
	% This means that you have to replace both $\phi(a_n,b_n)$ and $\psi(a_n,b_n)$ with explicit formulae.
	% There is no need to show how you worked out what should replace $\phi$ and $\psi$, just enter the replacements into the statement of the lemma and then give the proof as if you always had always known what $\phi$ and $\psi$ are.
	% THE SYMBOLS $\phi$ AND $\psi$ SHOULD NOT APPEAR ANYWHERE IN THE STATEMENT OF THE LEMMA OR THE PROOF WHEN YOU SUBMIT.
	%
	% The proof is by induction.
	%
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\end{proof}

\begin{thm} \label{thm:irrootional-eg}
	The number $1+\sqrt{2}$ is irrootional.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	%
	% HINTS
	%
	% The proof can begin in a similar way to that in which the proof that $\sqrt{2}\notin\RR$ began.
	% Informed by lemma~\ref{lem:powers-of-1+sqrt2}, try to get rid of all roots so that you have an equation of integers.
	% Later it may help to make use of the some of the results related to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
	%
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\end{proof}

\section{$n$-ary representations of integers}

\begin{defn} \label{defn:n-ary-sequence}
	For any integer $n\geq2$, a sequence $(a_j)_{j\in\NN^0}$ is called \emph{$n$-ary} if
	$$
		\{a_j:j\in\NN\}\subset\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}.
	$$
\end{defn}

\begin{thm} \label{thm:n-ary-rep-int}
	For each $x\in\NN^0$, and for each integer $n\geq2$, there exists an eventually zero $n$-ary sequence $(a_j)_{j\in\NN^0}$ such that
	$$
		x = \sum_{j=0}^\infty a_j n^j.
	$$
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	%
	% HINTS
	%
	% Look for a similar theorem in the Proofs So Far.
	% You will have to extend the argument a bit.
	%
