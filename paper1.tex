\section{Mean-spirited} \label{sec:mean-spirited}

\begin{thm} \label{thm:mean-spirited}
	For all $a,b,c>0$,
	$$
		\frac{a^2}{bc} + \frac{b^2}{ca} + \frac{c^2}{ab} \geq 3.
	$$
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Invalid proof of theorem~\ref{thm:mean-spirited}]
	Suppose (for a contradiction) that
	$$
		\frac{a^2}{bc} + \frac{b^2}{ca} + \frac{c^2}{ab} < 3.
	$$
	Then this inequality must be true for the particular choice of $a=b=c=1>0$.
	But
	$$
		\frac{1^2}{1\times1} + \frac{1^2}{1\times1} + \frac{1^2}{1\times1} = 1+1+1 = 3 \not< 3.
	$$
	This contradicts our assumption, so the theorem is true.

%
Although the theorem is true, the proof is not adequate.
The negation on the theorem's statement is done incorrectly. 
The statement is, $\forall a,b,c >0$, 
$$
	\frac{a^2}{bc} + \frac{b^2}{ca} + \frac{c^2}{ab} \geq 3.
$$ 
The correct negation would then be: there $\exists a,b,c >0$ such that 
$$
	\frac{a^2}{bc} + \frac{b^2}{ca} + \frac{c^2}{ab} < 3.
$$
The proof by contradiction above is done by giving one counterexample against the negation.
However, this is not sufficient because you have to show that do not exist $a,b,$ or $c >0$ that satisfies the property. 
Therefore, the proof is incorrect.

		From the AM-GM inequality, we know

		\frac{a+b+c}{3} \geq \sqrt[3]{abc}. 
		\end{align*}
		Because we know $abc$ is a positive number, $\sqrt[3]{abc}$ is also positive. So, we can perform the following,
		\begin{align*}
		\frac{(a+b+c)(\sqrt[3]{abc})^2}{3} &\geq abc \\
		\frac{(a+b+c)}{(abc)^{\frac{1}{3}}} &\geq 3 \\
		\frac{(a)^{\frac{2}{3}}}{(bc)^{\frac{1}{3}}} + \frac{(b)^{\frac{2}{3}}}{(ac)^{\frac{1}{3}}} + \frac{(c)^{\frac{2}{3}}}{(ab)^{\frac{1}{3}}}&\geq 3 \\
		\sqrt[3]{\frac{a^2}{bc}}+\sqrt[3]{\frac{b^2}{ac}}+\sqrt[3]{\frac{c^2}{ab}}&\geq 3
		\end{align*}
		We know that all terms are positive in the above inequality, so,
		$$ \frac{a^2}{bc} + \frac{b^2}{ac} + \frac{c^2}{ac} \geq \sqrt[3]{\frac{a^2}{bc}}+\sqrt[3]{\frac{b^2}{ac}}+\sqrt[3]{\frac{c^2}{ab}}\geq3.$$
		This implies that

\section{Rationals can always be expressed as ratios as arbitrary powers{\dots}or can they?}

\noindent\emph{The below claimed theorem and proof may or may not be correct.}

\begin{thm} \label{thm:power-rational}
	For each $m,n\in\NN$, and for every positive $x\in\QQ$, there exist $a,b\in\NN$ such that $x = a^m / b^n$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
	By definition, each positive rational can be expressed as $a^1/b^1$ for some choice of naturals $a,b$.
	Suppose that $x\in\QQ$ is such that $x=a^m/b$ for some $m\in\NN$.
	Then
	$$
		x = \frac{a^{m+1}}{ab} = \frac{(a)^{m+1}}{(ab)^1} = \frac{\alpha^{m+1}}{\beta},
	$$
	using $\alpha=a\in\NN$ and $\beta=ab\in\NN$.
	Hence, by induction on $m$, for every $m\in\NN$, and for every positive $x\in\QQ$, there exist $a,b\in\NN$ such that $x = a^m / b$.
	
	Now suppose that $x\in\QQ$ is such that $x=a/b^n$ for some $n\in\NN$.
	Then
	$$
		x = \frac{ab}{b^{n+1}} = \frac{(ab)^1}{(b)^{n+1}} = \frac{\alpha}{\beta^{n+1}},
	$$
	using $\alpha=ab\in\NN$ and $\beta=b\in\NN$.
	Hence, by induction on $n$, for every $n\in\NN$, and for every positive $x\in\QQ$, there exist $a,b\in\NN$ such that $x = a / b^n$.
	
	It follows that for every $m,n\in\NN$, and for every positive $x\in\QQ$, there exist $a,b\in\NN$ such that $x = a^m / b^n$.
\end{proof}

\noindent\emph{Discussion}:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% DISCUSS THE ABOVE CLAIMED THEOREM AND PROOF.
% YOU SHOULD WRITE TWO OR THREE PARAGRAPHS TO DISCUSS THE ISSUES BELOW.
%
% 1. Is the theorem true or false. If the theorem is false, can you disprove it?
% 2. Whether or not the theorem is true, is the proof correct or incorrect? If there are any errors in the proof, point them out and, if possible, correct.
% 3. Are there any parts of the proof that could be made more efficient?
%
The theorem is false, because there is a counter example to the theorem. Take $x=2$, and $m=n=2$.
Then if we assume that the theorem is true, we can write, with naturals $a,b$ $$2=\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^2.$$
Because $a,b$ are positive, 
	$$\sqrt{2}=\frac{a}{b}.$$
However, this is impossible because $\dfrac{a}{b}$ is a rational number, but $\sqrt{2}$ is not.
So there is a contradiction, and the theorem is disproved.

So, the proof does not prove the theorem, but it was able to prove, through induction, that $x=a^m/b$ works and $x=a/b^n$ works independently. 
However, it does not follow that for every $m,n\in\NN$, and for every positive $x\in\QQ$, there exist $a,b\in\NN$ such that $x = a^m / b^n$.

\section{An irrootional number}

\begin{defn} \label{defn:rootional}
	The \emph{rootionals} (or \emph{rootional numbers}) are the natural roots of rational numbers.
	They are the answers to the question ``Of what should I multiply $n$ copies to get $x$?'', when $0<x\in\QQ$, and $n\in\NN$.
	The \emph{set of rootionals} is denoted $\mathbb{P}$.
	A real number which is not rootional is called \emph{irrootional}.
\end{defn}

\begin{lem} \label{lem:powers-of-1+sqrt2}
	% THE SYMBOLS $\phi$ AND $\psi$ SHOULD NOT APPEAR ANYWHERE IN THE STATEMENT OF THE THEOREM OR THE PROOF WHEN YOU SUBMIT.
	% REPLACE $\phi$ and $\psi$ WITH EXPLICIT FORMULAE.
	The sequences $(a_n)_{n\in\NN}$, $(b_n)_{n\in\NN}$ given by
	\begin{align*}
		a_1 &= 1 & a_{n+1} &= a_n+2b_n, & n &\in\NN, \\
		b_1 &= 1 & b_{n+1} &= a_n+b_n, & n &\in\NN,
	\end{align*}
	satisfy both
	$$
		\left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)^n = a_n + b_n \sqrt{2} \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad a_n^2-2b_n^2 = (-1)^n,
	$$
	for all $n\in\NN$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	%
	% HINTS
	%
	% First you have to complete the statement of the lemma.
	% This means that you have to replace both $\phi(a_n,b_n)$ and $\psi(a_n,b_n)$ with explicit formulae.
	% There is no need to show how you worked out what should replace $\phi$ and $\psi$, just enter the replacements into the statement of the lemma and then give the proof as if you always had always known what $\phi$ and $\psi$ are.
	% THE SYMBOLS $\phi$ AND $\psi$ SHOULD NOT APPEAR ANYWHERE IN THE STATEMENT OF THE LEMMA OR THE PROOF WHEN YOU SUBMIT.
	%
	% The proof is by induction.
	%
	First, we want to show that the sequence satisfies the first equation,
	$$\left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)^n = a_n + b_n \sqrt{2}.$$
	When $n=1$ the equations holds,
	\begin{align*}
		\mbox{LHS} = \left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)^1=1+\sqrt{2}\\	
		\mbox{RHS} = a_1+b_1\sqrt{2}=1+\sqrt{2}.
	\end{align*}
	So, $\mbox{LHS} = \mbox{RHS},$ and the equation holds for $n=1$.
	Assume the equations holds for a particular natural number $n$.
	Now, we want to show that the equation also holds for $n+1$.
	From our assumption we know,
	\begin{align*}
		\left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)^n &= a_n + b_n \sqrt{2}\\
		\left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)^n(1+\sqrt{2}) &= (a_n + b_n \sqrt{2})(1+\sqrt{2})\\
		\left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)^{n+1}&= a_n + a_n\sqrt{2} + b_n\sqrt{2} +2b_n\\
		\left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)^{n+1}&= (a_n+2b_n) + (a_n+b_n)\sqrt{2}\\
		\left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)^{n+1} &= (a_{n+1}) + (b_{n+1})\sqrt{2}
	\end{align*}
	Hence, the equation holds for $n+1$ when it holds for $n$. 
	By induction on $n$, the equation holds for all natural number $n$.
	
	Next, we will show that the following equation also holds for the described sequences:
	$$a_n^2-2b_n^2 = (-1)^n.$$
	When $n=1$,
	\begin{align*}
	\mbox{LHS} = a_1^2-2b_1^2=1-2=-1\\	
	\mbox{RHS} = (-1)^1=-1.
	\end{align*}
	So $\mbox{LHS} = \mbox{RHS},$ and the equation holds for $n=1.$
	Now, assume that the equation holds for a particular natural number $n$.
	We want to show that the equation must also hold for $n+1$.
	Now, consider
	\begin{align*}
		a_{n+1}^2-2b_{n+1}^2 &= (a_n+2b_n)^2-2(b_n+a_n)^2\\
		&= a_n^2 + 4b_na_n +4b^2_n - 2(b_n^2+2a_nb_n+a_n^2)\\
		&= 2b_n^2-a^2_n\\
		&= -1(a^2_n-2b_n^2).
	\end{align*}
	We know from our induction hypothesis that $a_n^2-2b_n^2 = (-1)^n$, so
	\begin{align*}
		a_{n+1}^2-2b_{n+1}^2 &= -1(-1)^n \\
		a_{n+1}^2-2b_{n+1}^2 &= (-1)^{n+1}.
	\end{align*}
	Therefore, the equation holds for $n+1$, if it holds for a natural number $n$. By induction on $n$, the equation holds for all natural number $n$.
	
	So, it follows that  $(a_n)_{n\in\NN}$, $(b_n)_{n\in\NN}$ satisfy both 
	$$
	\left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)^n = a_n + b_n \sqrt{2} \qquad\mbox{and}\qquad a_n^2-2b_n^2 = (-1)^n,
	$$
	for all $n\in\NN$.
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\end{proof}

\begin{thm} \label{thm:irrootional-eg}
	The number $1+\sqrt{2}$ is irrootional.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	%
	% HINTS
	%
	 %The proof can begin in a similar way to that in which the proof that $\sqrt{2}\notin\RR$ began.
	 %Informed by lemma~\ref{lem:powers-of-1+sqrt2}, try to get rid of all roots so that you have an equation of integers.
	 %Later it may help to make use of the some of the results related to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
	%
	For a contradiction, let us assume that $1+\sqrt{2}$ is rootional. This means that there exists natural power of $1+\sqrt{2}$ that is equal to a rational number.  So, we can write
	$$ \left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)^n = \frac{c}{d} $$
	for natural number $n$ and integers $c,d$. From Lemma 4, we know that \\
	$\left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)^n = a_n + b_n \sqrt{2}$, so substituting this into the earlier equation yields
	\begin{align*}
		a_n + b_n \sqrt{2} &= \frac{c}{d} \\
		\sqrt{2} &= \frac{\frac{c}{d}-a_n}{b_n} \\
		\sqrt{2} &= \frac{c-a_nd}{b_nd}
	\end{align*}
	We know from the definition of $a_n, b_n$ in Lemma 4 that they are both integers, because the terms in sequences $(a_n)_{n\in\NN}$, $(b_n)_{n\in\NN}$ are constructed simply by adding up previous integer terms, which are initialized at $1$. 
	Since by assumption $c$ and $d$ are also integers, $\dfrac{c-a_nd}{b_nd}$ is just a  quotient of two integers, which defines a rational number. So the RHS is rational, but we know that $\sqrt{2}$, which is the LHS, is irrational. 
	
	Therefore, there is a contradiction and $1+\sqrt{2}$ is irrootional.

\section{$n$-ary representations of integers}

\begin{defn} \label{defn:n-ary-sequence}
	For any integer $n\geq2$, a sequence $(a_j)_{j\in\NN^0}$ is called \emph{$n$-ary} if
	$$
		\{a_j:j\in\NN\}\subset\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}.
	$$
\end{defn}

\begin{thm} \label{thm:n-ary-rep-int}
	For each $x\in\NN^0$, and for each integer $n\geq2$, there exists an eventually zero $n$-ary sequence $(a_j)_{j\in\NN^0}$ such that
	$$
		x = \sum_{j=0}^\infty a_j n^j.
	$$
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	%
	% HINTS
	%
	% Look for a similar theorem in the Proofs So Far.
	% You will have to extend the argument a bit.
	%
	Let $P(x)$ be the statement of the theorem. $P(0)$ is trivially true because if we write, 
	$$
		0 = \sum_{j=0}^\infty a_j n^j,
	$$
	the certainly exists an $n$-ary sequence $(a_j)_{j\in\NN^0}$ that is just the infinite sequence with all 0s. This sequence would be $n$-ary for every $n$ because for the the smallest $n$, which is 2, $\{0\}\subset\{0,1\}$.
	
	Now, let $x$ be a natural number such that $x>0$, and suppose that $P(k)$ is true for all integer $k$ such that $0\leq k\leq x$. Now, we want to show that $P(x+1)$ is also true.
	
	If $x+1$ is divisible by $n$, then $\frac{x+1}{n}\in \NNzero$ and $0\leq\frac{x+1}{n}\leq x$. Since we know that $P(k)$ is true, we know that there exists an $n$-ary sequence such that 
	$$
		\frac{x+1}{n} = \sum_{j=0}^\infty a_{\frac{x+1}{n},j} n^j
	$$
	where $a_{\frac{x+1}{n},j}$ is the $j$th term in the sequence $a_{\frac{x+1}{n}}$
	Manipulating this equation yields, 
	\begin{align*}
		x+1 &= \sum_{j=0}^\infty a_{\frac{x+1}{n},j} n^{j+1} \\
		x+1 &= \sum_{j=1}^\infty a_{\frac{x+1}{n},j-1} n^{j}.
	\end{align*}
	Now let us define a new sequence $a_{x+1}$ such that $a_{x+1,j} = a_{\frac{x+1}{n},j-1}$
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
