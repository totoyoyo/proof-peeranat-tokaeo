We argue that real multiplication, as defined through multiplication of rational Cauchy sequences, satisfies the corresponding five field axioms.

\begin{lem} \label{lem:ExistsNonzeroCauchySequence}
	Suppose that $x\in\RR\setminus\{0_\RR\}$.
	Then there is a rational $M>0$ and a Cauchy sequence $(x_n)_{n\in\NN}$ such every term has $|x_n|>M$ and $(x_n)_{n\in\NN}$ belongs to the equivalence class $x$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
	%--------------EDIT THIS PART--------------%
	% Hint: The idea is to argue that there is a rational Cauchy sequence in $x$ for which at most finitely many terms are less than $M$.
	% Try contradiction; you should end up proving $x=0_\RR$.
	% After that, you can fix the finitely many ``problem'' terms without changing the equivalence class of your Cauchy sequence.
	%------------------------------------------%
\end{proof}

\begin{thm} \label{thm:RealMultiplication}
	Real multiplication, defined as the descent of multiplication of rational Cauchy sequences, obeys field axioms~\textup{(6)--(10)}.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
	%--------------EDIT THIS PART--------------%
	% Hint: Axioms~(6)--(9) essentially follow from the corresponding properties for rational numbers.
	% For axiom~(10), the tricky part is showing that the sequence you want to represent the multiplicative inverse is actually a Cauchy sequence.
	% It might be easiest to start by structuring the proof as if you have a magical lemma that guarantees the sequence is Cauchy, then go back and fill the gap, using lemma~\ref{lem:ExistsNonzeroCauchySequence} and some ingenuity.
	%------------------------------------------%
\end{proof}
