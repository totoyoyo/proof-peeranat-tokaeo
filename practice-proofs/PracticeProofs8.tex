We aim to construct real numbers as equivalence classes of rational Cauchy sequences.
We will eventually have to show that adding and multiplying real numbers produces real numbers (see the field axioms), so it would help to know that adding and multiplying the underlying objects, rational Cauchy sequences, produces more rational Cauchy sequences.

\begin{prop} \label{prop:RationalCauchyClosedUnderSum}
	Suppose that $(a_n)_{n\in\NN}$ and $(b_n)_{n\in\NN}$ are both rational Cauchy sequences.
	Then $(a_n+b_n)_{n\in\NN}$ is also a rational Cauchy sequence.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
	%--------------EDIT THIS PART--------------%
	% Hint: In the definition of a Cauchy sequence, replace the symbol $\epsilon$ with the symbol $\delta$, and $N(\epsilon)$ with $N_a(\delta)$ for the first sequence and $N_b(\delta)$ for the second.
	% Write down the statement you are trying to prove (i.e.\ the definition of a Cauchy sequence).
	% Try using the triangle inequality and choosing $N$ in a clever way.
	%------------------------------------------%
\end{proof}

\begin{prop} \label{prop:RationalCauchyClosedUnderProduct}
	Suppose that $(a_n)_{n\in\NN}$ and $(b_n)_{n\in\NN}$ are both rational Cauchy sequences.
	Then $(a_nb_n)_{n\in\NN}$ is also a rational Cauchy sequence.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
	The rational numbers are closed under multiplication, so $(a_nb_n)_{n\in\NN}$ is a rational sequence.
	
	As both of the original sequences are Cauchy, they are both bounded.
	So we can choose a positive rational number $M$ that is a common bound for both sequences, in the sense that, for all $n\in\NN$, $|a_n|,|b_n|<M$.
	Let $\delta>0$.
	Then there exist natural numbers $N_a(\delta),N_b(\delta)$ such that
	\begin{align*}
		&\mbox{if } m,n > N_a(\delta), \mbox{ then } |a_m-a_n|<\delta, \\
		&\mbox{if } m,n > N_b(\delta), \mbox{ then } |b_m-b_n|<\delta.
	\end{align*}
	Suppose $\epsilon>0$, set $N=\max\{N_a(\epsilon/2M),N_b(\epsilon/2M)\}$, and suppose that $m,n>N$.
	Then
	\begin{align*}
		|(a_mb_m) - (a_nb_n)| &= |(a_m-a_n)b_m + a_n(b_m-b_n)| \\
		&\leq |a_m-a_n||b_m| + |a_n||b_m-b_n| \\
		&< \frac{\epsilon}{2M}M + M\frac{\epsilon}{2M} = \epsilon.
	\end{align*}
	Therefore the sequence $(a_nb_n)_{n\in\NN}$ is Cauchy.
\end{proof}
